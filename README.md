# Car insurance quotation

This project is a car insurance quotation app made with React.

Using a form component the user chooses its car brand model, year and an insurance plan. Depending on the chosen options the insurance quotation is modified.

**What I've learned:**

- Props destructuring
- Form validation
- Adding Emotion for using styled components
- Using helper functions
- Adding animation with TransitionGroup

This project is part of the Udemy [React - La Guía Completa: Hooks Context Redux MERN +15 Apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-de-principiante-a-experto-creando-mas-de-10-aplicaciones/) course.
